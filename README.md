# RooTexT
simple fast root plots on the terminal

## TODO:
- [ ] use argparse for the command line arguments
- [ ] allow an optional argument for specifying "cuts" on ttrees - [ ] see uproot docs
- [ ] allow plotting histograms
- [ ] if only a file is given, list the keys in the file (like I did for when a tree is given without the branch name)
- [ ] allow ttree 2D plots with something like "y:x" for the branch names (makes a plot of branch y vs. branch x)
- [ ] option
- [ ] look into uniplot (https://github.com/olavolav/uniplot) as an alternative to plotext (or maybe allow either as an option)
- [ ] use the python logging package
- [ ] create a nice gif animation of its usage to put in the readme (see uniplot above)
- [ ] Learn how to use a testing package and make tests for each case
  (histogram 1D, 2D, etc. and ttree 1D, 2D, etc.)
